A simple web app designed to find acceleration, through given velocity and time fields.
Drawing a graph is a best way to interpret acceleration value.

- To get started, enter the x-axis scales, and y-axis scales according to the given velocity and time fields.
- To proceed further, click on the mark points buttons and mark the velocity with respect to time points on the graph.
- Finally, click on the Draw Lines button and connect the two points through drawing a line.

Choose two velocity-time ranges, and apply the acceleration formula.

- Thus, one can simply find acceleration value, in 2 3 steps through the app.
- Click on the Submit button to finish.
